# Compare the NFL's YouTube and Facebook Channels

Facebook is trying to rival YouTube as the go-to place for people to post videos online. So I wanted to see how that's going, using the NFL as a proxy. This app will take an NFL video posted to Facebook and one posted to YouTube
and display them next to each other compare their content, length, date uploaded and view counts. People will be able to click refresh to randomly check out more of the NFL's Facebook and YouTube videos.
